# Video-Index-Extraction-with-Interactive-Player

In this project, a solution is developed to:

2. Extract the logical index or table of contents in an automated manner.
3. Build an interactive player setup where users can jump to any index to browse the video/audio, allowing seamless navigation.

The algorithmic diagram can be summarized as below:
